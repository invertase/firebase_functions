# Contributing to Firebase Functions for Dart

Thank you for contributing to Firebase Functions for Dart! This guide will help you get set up and familiar with the project conventions.

## Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more information on pull requests.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Dart SDK** >= 3.9.0
- **Node.js** v22 (required for snapshot tests and the Firebase Emulator)
- **Java 21+** (required for the Firestore emulator)
- **Custom Firebase CLI** with Dart runtime support (the `@invertase/dart` branch of firebase-tools)

### Setup

1. Fork and clone the repository.

2. Install Dart dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd firebase-functions-dart
   dart pub get
   ```

3. Verify your setup by running the analyzer and tests:

   ```bash
   dart analyze --fatal-infos
   dart test --exclude-tags=snapshot,integration
   ```

```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests only (fast, no external dependencies)
dart test --exclude-tags=snapshot,integration

# Snapshot tests (compares generated manifests against Node.js reference)
dart test test/snapshots/ -t snapshot

# Build the manifest for a test fixture
cd test/fixtures/dart_reference
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
cd ../../..

# End-to-end tests (requires Firebase Emulator)
dart test test/e2e/e2e_test.dart
```

### Code Formatting and Analysis

```bash
# Check formatting (CI will reject unformatted code)
dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed .

# Apply formatting
dart format .

# Run the analyzer (must pass with zero issues)
dart analyze --fatal-infos
```

### Local Validation

You can run the full CI check suite locally before pushing:

```bash
dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed .
dart analyze --fatal-infos
dart test --exclude-tags=snapshot,integration
```

## Code Standards

### Style

The project uses strict analysis settings (`strict-casts`, `strict-inference`, `strict-raw-types`) and 49 linter rules defined in `analysis_options.yaml`. Key conventions:

- **Always declare return types** on functions and methods.
- **Use `final` for local variables** (`prefer_final_locals`).
- **Require trailing commas** in argument lists and collection literals.
- **Prefer relative imports** within the package.
- **Sort constructors first** in class declarations.

### Public API

- The public API is exported through `lib/firebase_functions.dart` (the barrel file). Only add exports there for types that users need directly.
- Classes in `lib/src/` are implementation details. They can be public (no underscore prefix) but should not be exported from the barrel file unless they are part of the public API.

### Documentation

- Add dartdoc (`///`) comments to all new public APIs.
- Include code examples in doc comments where they help clarify usage.

### Error Handling

- Use `HttpsError` with the appropriate `FunctionsErrorCode` for user-facing errors.
- Match the Node.js SDK error codes and behavior where applicable.

## Testing Requirements

- **All new features and bug fixes must include tests.**
- **Unit tests** go in `test/unit/`. Test components in isolation using `mocktail` for mocking.
- **Snapshot tests** validate that the Dart builder generates manifests compatible with the Node.js SDK. If your change affects YAML manifest generation, update or add snapshot tests in `test/snapshots/`.
- **E2E tests** in `test/e2e/` cover full request/response cycles against the Firebase Emulator. Add these for new trigger types or protocol changes.

See `test/snapshots/README.md` for details on the snapshot testing strategy.

## Pull Request Process

1. Create a feature branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes, including tests.
3. Run formatting, analysis, and tests locally (see commands above).
4. Push your branch and open a pull request.
5. Fill in the PR description:
   - **What** the change does and **why**.
   - Link to any related issues.
   - Note any breaking changes.
6. CI will run automatically. All checks must pass before merging.
7. A project maintainer will review and may request changes.

### Commit Messages

- Write clear, descriptive commit messages.
- Use imperative mood (e.g., "Add Pub/Sub retry support" not "Added Pub/Sub retry support").
- Reference issues with `#number` where applicable.

## CI/CD

The project has two GitHub Actions workflows:

- **test.yml** (push to `main`/`develop` and PRs): Runs lint + analysis, builder tests, snapshot tests, and E2E tests across stable and beta Dart SDKs.
- **pr-checks.yml** (PRs only): Fast validation with formatting, analysis, and snapshot checks.

See `.github/workflows/README.md` for full details on each job and how to debug failures.
