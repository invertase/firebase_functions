The `firebase_functions` package provides an SDK for defining Cloud Functions for Firebase in Dart.

Cloud Functions is a hosted, private, and scalable environment where you can run code. The Firebase SDK for Cloud Functions integrates the Firebase platform by letting you write code that responds to events and invokes functionality exposed by other Firebase features.

## Learn more

Learn more about the Firebase SDK for Cloud Functions in the [Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/) or [check out our samples](example/).

Here are some resources to get help:

## Usage

```dart
import 'package:firebase_functions/firebase_functions.dart';

void main(List<String> args) {
  runFunctions((firebase) {
    firebase.https.onRequest(
      name: 'hello',
      (request) async {
        return Response.ok('Hello from Dart!');
      },
    );
  });
}
```

## Status: Experimental

This package provides a Dart implementation of Firebase Cloud Functions. Only HTTPS triggers are currently supported in production. Other trigger types are experimental and have [varying levels of support](./doc/triggers.md).
